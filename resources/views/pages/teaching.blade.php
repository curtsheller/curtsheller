            <p>Taking advantage of my jazz guitar skills and over 30 years of private study with internationally recognized virtuoso and master teacher Chuck Anderson, I began pursuing the potential of the ukulele. Researching the field I saw very little material organized at an intermediate or advanced level that really worked for players wanting to explore the ukulele beyond the basics. I have developed an international reputation as a ukulele educator having written many books on the subject of ukulele.</p>

            <p>Curt runs and maintains the very popular <b>www.LearningUkulele.com</b> web site with over 600 lessons. Check out the Workshops page for <a href="//www.learningUkulele.com/workshops/ukulele">available ukulele workshops</a> that Curt has presented across the country at various ukulele festivals over the past 10 years.</p>

        <p>Here are a few comments I've received over the years regarding my teaching.</p>

        <h5>QuickStart Scale Fingerings for Ukulele <small>by Curt Sheller</small></h5>

        <p><img class="top img-thumbnail" width="98" src="/images/covers/QS1UKES-cover.png" alt=""> ( from satisfied customer ) CS, Man, I broke the code!!! I&lsquo;ve had you books for quite a while and never understood them. I live on the island of Lanai in Hawaii and a large number of guys can jam and they have tried the help, but could not read or understand the music. A new young guy moved here from Oahu and started teaching lessons. I started taking lessons from him and again, he did not understand what you books were all about. Being a teacher myself I knew there was a great deal of knowledge in your books and I could help him in setting up his lesson plans for his classes. I also told him that you basic books would be great for his students. After my 3rd lesson I broke out you Quickstart Book and it took us about 45 minutes to break the code. The power of reading! I will continue to tell lessons just because the local sound is so fresh but, this blues stuff w/local music will be off the hook. Thanks again. I will be buying more books and I will try to get his contact information. ! His uncle was Bratha "IZ" - <b><b>Kevin L. Humphrey</b></b></p>

            <p><img class="right img-thumbnail" width="98" src="/images/cd/Midnight_at_the_Jazz_cafe.png" alt=""> Received your CD just prior to leaving on a trip last week. Listened to it for 600 miles. Please keep me in mind should you EVER do another one of jazz standards. The only thing I'm sorry about is that I don't live close enough to come see you play live or to get lessons from you.</p>

            <p>Also thanks for the picks. I've never used that style of pick before, but find that the notes come easier and sound better when using them. They took a bit of getting used to, but now they're all I use.</p>

            <p>Best of luck to you. You're a great player. - <b>Jim Weller</b></p>

            <p>Just browsing over both books, they look fantastic! I'm a guitarist and uke player for over 25 years and was thinking about writing a ukulele book but you've already written what I think are the best, most comprehensive and thorough books I've ever seen for the instrument. I just might end up buying every book you've written and I'll be giving my highest recommendation for your books to my friends and students. Thank you so much for taking the time to write such great books! &mdash; <b>Peter Rhee</b></p>

        <p>I wanted to pay you a compliment. (Now don't get a big head!). I have purchased many books over the past 15 years I have been playing and none of them come even close to having the detailed and easy to understand information yours have. I really got a chance to get some practicing in and am finding your books to be such a great learning tool. I also purchased a timer like you suggested and my practice sessions the past 4 days have been my best in years. - Take care, - <b>Nick Matty</b></p>

        <p>Your chord of the week lessons are great! Really opened my eyes as to what I was doing & has allowed me to figure out the best way to play the chords I need, depending on the arrangement. Ive actually only looked at the first 2 weeks so far, then worked out the 3rd week myself.</p>

        <p>I especially like the way that each week builds on what was learned the previous, so you are incorporating all the forms into the exercises!</p>

        <p>Thanks guys!</p>

        <h5>A Guide to Ukulele Chords <small>by Curt Sheller</small></h5>

        <p><img class="top img-thumbnail" src="/images/covers/BC1UKE-cover.png" width="128" alt=""><b>Curt Sheller</b> is a jazz guitarist with a love for the uke. He has turned his copious and capable knowledge of music theory, and chord theory in particular, and put out some very accessible and worthwhile books. His 'A Guide to Blues Chord Progressions for Ukulele from A to Z' will give you the changes essential to blues and jazz. 'A Guide to Ukulele Chords' is authoritative, concise, direct, and informative.</p>

        <p>It is a great primary source for knowledge of chords for someone approaching music theory armed with a uke. James Hill wrote the intro.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m finding all sorts of spiffy stuff in 'QUICKSTART Scale Fingerings for Ukulele'.</p>

        <p>These and other excellent learning aides can be found on Sheller&rsquo;s site: www.LearningUkulele.com
        He also sent me 'Midnight at the Jazz Caf&eacute;', a CD of his guitar work, which is on in the background all the while I&rsquo;m writing this. Not ukulele, but pleasant listening. - <b>Uke Jackson</b></p>

        <p class="text-gray-500 m-x"><em><b>Note</b> - This book has been used for courses at <b>Kap'olani Community College</b> and <b>Honolulu Community College</b> in Hawaii for the past several years.</em></p>

        <p>Curt, I really enjoyed your set at The Whiskey--your low key intros, mic persona provided a cool contrast with your complex uke technique and ingenious arrangements! - Best wishes, <b>Jared Denhard</b></p>

        <p>I'm glad you had fun and despite being very busy it was a pleasure to meet and hear you. Last night I had a few beers with my "crew" and they were asked who was a standout act , and you won "most technically proficient" player . The audience seemed to have really enjoyed your set and when the audio is ready I'll send it down to you. - Rich <b>"Amazing Dick" Leufstedt - UkeStock 2008</b></p>
