            <h3>Learning the Ukulele Fingerboard</h3>

            <p>If there's one this when learning the ukulele that gives you one of the biggest return for your investment in time to learn - It's learning the names of the note of the ukulele fingerboard. This isn't learning to read music, it's as simply expanding on and learning more than open strings that you might already know. Every frets has names with two other frets using only the natural letters of music (A B C D E F G). Fret (5) in C tuning, low or high G is: <b>C F A D</b>. Fret (7) is <b>D G B E</b>. It's really that simple and one of the things you can do without actually having to hold an actual ukulele.</p>
