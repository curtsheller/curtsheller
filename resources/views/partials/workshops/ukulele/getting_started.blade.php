<h4>Where Do I Start?</h4>

<p><b>Where Do I Start?</b> - This is a common question and this workshop addresses that very question.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started - A Recipe for Success</b> covers ukulele tunings, learning the ukulele fingerboard, basic chords and strums. This workshop gets you rolling on having some fun playing the ukulele and we throw in a bit of ukulele history and fun facts as we explore the ukulele.</p>
