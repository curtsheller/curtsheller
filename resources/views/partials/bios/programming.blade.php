        <h5>Graphic Artist</h5>
        
        <p><img class="right" src="/images/curtieAnim.gif" alt="">I started my professional working career as a graphic artist. I starting drawing from the Sunday comics at 8 years old. After my stint in the Navy I went to The Studio School of Art and Design in Philadelphia, PA, a two year art school for Commercial Art.</p>
        
        <p>As a graphic designer and artist I now mainly focus my efforts in the music industry for a select group fellow musicians and artists.</p>

        <h5>Musician</h5>
        
        <p>Stated guitar at 9 and have been too stubborn to give it up. Stick with anything long enough and you tend to get good at it. Hook up with the right teacher and mentors and get really good.</p>

        <p>To key to success in any field is, to a large extent, is really as simply as doing quality exploration over and over and over. And hooking up with the right teachers and mentors.</p>

        <h5>Author</h5>
        
            <p>I've written over <b>40</b> books for ukulele, guitar and music.</p>
        
        <h5>Publisher</h5>
        
            <p>I currently publish and handle distribution for all my own books and on-line lessons.</p>

            <p>I do have a few select dealers that carry my books.</p>

        <h5>Programmer</h5>
        
            <p>Taught myself how to program starting with HyperTalk and Hypercard around 1987 and then proceeded up to a few independent contracting assignments using C++, MacApp and Java. Now I focus on PHP and JavaScript for my web development.  My CurtSheller.com web and LearningUkulele.com site are all hand coded using PHP, HTML, Javascript and MySQL. <b>2015 Update</b> - LearningUkulele.com is developed using <a href="//laravel.com"><b>Laravel</b></a> a MCV open source PHP framework. So that Smalltalk book I bought last century can finally payoff.</p>
