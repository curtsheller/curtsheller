    <p class="text-sm"><strong class="text-brand font-extrabold tracking-wide">2022 Updates:</strong> Seems there is no longer a 10 Miler on the boards. The old Ron Zinn spring 10 miler has been 10 km for a bit and the Polar Bear is now a 5 km. Will have to see if the Coney Island 10 Miler is still a race.</p>

            <p>Finally getting back into it. End of age-group coming up and setting some goals to approaching a new age-group.</p>

            <p><strong class="text-brand font-extrabold tracking-wide">February 2016 Update:</strong> Updating the racewalking section of the site and see that it's been 10 years since that last race. Did OK then and now <em>really, really</em> want to get back into racing shape and now maybe have the time.</p>

            <p><strong class="text-brand font-extrabold tracking-wide">December 2008 Update:</strong> This is the race that I'm getting back into training for. I'm not leaving myself much time (weeks) to do it. But this is the last chance to get a race in in my 50 to 54 age group. A goal is to finish and start training and get back to racing.</p>
