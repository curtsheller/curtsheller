        <h2>History of IAAF World Race Walking Cup</h2>
        <p>The <b>World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships</b> is a racewalking event organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It has been held since 1961, and generally on a biennial basis. Women first entered the 1979 edition. It was formerly known as the <b>Lugano Cup</b> after the city that hosted the first event, then became the <b>IAAF World Race Walking Cup</b> until 2016 and than <b>IAAF World Race Walking Team Championships</b> until 2018. In 2004, a junior division was added, consisting of men and women aged under 20. Since 2008 it has been a constituent meeting of the <span class="text-green-700 font-black">IAAF Race Walking Challenge</span>.</p>

        <p>From 1975 to 1997 was awarded Lugano Trophy for combined team (20K + 50K). Since 1993 the medals have been awarded for the single events of the 20K and 50K teams, therefore in the 1993, 1995 and 1997 editions three team medals were assigned, from 1999 the combined was abolished and the team medals remained two until the present day.</p>

        <p class="text-green-700 text-center font-bold mx-12">Seems to be a moving target as to what this event is called, is known by, has been known by... Basically it's a <em>team</em> event and they used give give a <em>cup</em> away &mdash;The Lugano Cup. That's my take.</p>
