<p class="">In the summer of 2003, I fell in love with the ukulele and all its possibilities. My journey exploring the ukulele began on a CampFire USA trip to South Dakota planned by my wife, Bernadette. I’d searched the Internet for a small travel guitar to bring with me, and rediscovered the ukulele instead - after a twenty year break. &ndash; <b>Curt</b></p>

<h4 class="m-t">Introduction <small>&bull; A fun radio introduction</small></h4>
    <p>This is just a fun introduction that Glenn Barratt and myself threw together in the studio at mixing and mastering time. It's an idea I've had floating around for awhile.</p>

<h4 class="m-t">Sway <small>&bull; Luis Demetrio, Pablo Beltran Ruiz</small></h4>
    <p>1953 mambo instrumental song by Mexican composers Luis Demetrio and Pablo Beltran Ruiz. The most famous English version is that of Dean Martin recorded in 1954. I first heard it in the Antonio Banderas movie Take the Lead (2006) where he was a dance instructor.</p>

    <p>An original song created as a result of a weekend of jamming with Glen Hirabayashi of the Aloha Boys. Glen and his wife Donna came up to the Philadelphia Folk Festival in 2013 where we where a vendor and hung out all weekend with us. A great weekend of jamming.</p>

<h4 class="m-t">A Spy In Love <small>&bull; Herb Ohta, Jim Beloff</small></h4>
    <p>A composition by Jim Beloff with music by Herb Ohta. Jim is one of the people responsible for this latest ukulele craze - which at this point looks like it is here to stay. They said the same thing regarding the guitar and rock'n'roll, that it wouldn't stick around.</p>

    <p>Jim has a great catalog of songs he has written over the years and A Spy In Love is a gem.</p>

<h4 class="m-t">Rain Shine <small>&bull; Chuck Anderson</small></h4>
    <p>I studied for over 30 years with Chuck Anderson, one of the most knowledgeable musicians I've had the privilege to know and a great mentor. In addition to being a virtuoso jazz guitarist, Chuck's compositions separate him the rest of the pack and Rain Shine is one of those songs. Chuck was kind enough to let me record this song - the first recording of the Rain Shine.</p>

<h4 class="m-t">My Favorite Things <small>&bull; Sayre, Hammerstein, Rodgers</small></h4>
    <p>Thanks to John Coltrane this song is part of the standard jazz repertoire. I also recorded it as a trio with guitar in 2002 on my Midnight at the Jazz Cafe. Take a listen below for a comparison. Both are performed in the Jazz Waltz style.</p>

<h4 class="m-t">Georgia ( <em>Georgia on My Mind</em> ) <small>&bull; H. Carmichael, S. Gore</small></h4>
    <p>Lovely, bluesy ballad in the key of F.</p>
    <p>"Georgia on My Mind" is a song by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell, closely associated with the cover version by Ray Charles, a native of Georgia, who recorded it for his 1960 album The Genius Hits the Road. It became the official state song of Georgia in 1979.</p>

    <p>The song was written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). Although it is frequently asserted that the lyrics were written not about the state of Georgia, but rather for Carmichael's sister, Georgia Carmichael, Hoagy Carmichael himself contradicted this view with his recounting of the origin of the song in his second autobiography Sometimes I Wonder. Carmichael wrote that the song was composed when bandleader Frankie Trumbauer suggested that he write about the state of Georgia. According to Carmichael, Trumbauer also suggested the opening lyrics should be "Georgia, Georgia ...", with the remaining lyrics coming from Gorell. Carmichael made no mention at all of his sister in his telling of the song's genesis.</p>

<h4 class="m-t">Milestones <small>&bull; Miles Davis</small></h4>
    <p>An up tempo modal song in G Dorian and A Aeolian. We typically play this a break-neck tempo. First take got away from us and this one is bit more under control. Recorded with a Pono Thinline Mango tenor as the previous song I used my Ko'olau CS tenor ( <em>pictured above</em> ) and string one broke right at the end of the song. Luckily it was in the planned fade out and we had enough for that take. And as any ukulele player knows it takes awhile for ukulele strings to stretch out - hences the switch to the Mango Pono.</p>

    <p>I also recorded it as a trio with guitar in 2002 on my Midnight at the Jazz Cafe CD. Take a listen below for comparison, a little quicker this go around.</p>

<h4 class="m-t">Summer's Dawn <small>&bull; Curt Sheller</small></h4>

    <p>Actually started out an an exercise just doodling around with a harmonized triad chord scale in the key of G major. Amazing what can come about from just noodling around on the uke.</p>
