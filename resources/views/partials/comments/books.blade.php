        <p><img class="float-left img-thumbnail mr-2" width="98" src="/images/covers/QS1UKES-cover.png" alt="">( from satisfied customer ) CS, Man, I broke the code!!! I&lsquo;ve had you books for quite a while and never understood them. I live on the island of Lanai in Hawaii and a large number of guys can jam and they have tried the help, but could not read or understand the music. A new young guy moved here from Oahu and started teaching lessons. I started taking lessons from him and again, he did not understand what you books were all about. Being a teacher myself I knew there was a great deal of knowledge in your books and I could help him in setting up his lesson plans for his classes. I also told him that you basic books would be great for his students. After my 3rd lesson I broke out you Quickstart Book and it took us about 45 minutes to break the code. The power of reading! I will continue to tell lessons just because the local sound is so fresh but, this blues stuff w/local music will be off the hook. Thanks again. I will be buying more books and I will try to get his contact information. ! His uncle was Bratha "IZ" - <b><b>Kevin L. Humphrey</b></b></p>

    <h4>A Guide to Ukulele Chords <small>by Curt Sheller</small></h4>
    <div class="clear">
        <p><img class="float-left img-thumbnail mr-2" src="/images/covers/BC1UKE-cover.png" width="128" alt=""><b>Curt Sheller</b> is a jazz guitarist with a love for the uke. He has turned his copious and capable knowledge of music theory, and chord theory in particular, and put out some very accessible and worthwhile books. His 'A Guide to Blues Chord Progressions for Ukulele from A to Z' will give you the changes essential to blues and jazz. 'A Guide to Ukulele Chords' is authoritative, concise, direct, and informative.</p>

        <p>It is a great primary source for knowledge of chords for someone approaching music theory armed with a uke. James Hill wrote the intro.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m finding all sorts of spiffy stuff in 'QUICKSTART Scale Fingerings for Ukulele'..<br><br>

        <p>These and other excellent learning aides can be found on Sheller&rsquo;s site: www.LearningUkulele.com
        He also sent me 'Midnight at the Jazz Caf&eacute;', a CD of his guitar work, which is on in the background all the while I&rsquo;m writing this. Not ukulele, but pleasant listening. - <b>Uke Jackson</b></p>

        <p class="text-gray-500 mx-12"><em><b>Note</b> - This book has been used for courses at <b>Kap'olani Community College</b> and <b>Honolulu Community College</b> in Hawaii for the past several years.</em></p>

        <p>Just browsing over both books, they look fantastic! I'm a guitarist and uke player for over 25 years and was thinking about writing a ukulele book but you've already written what I think are the best, most comprehensive and thorough books I've ever seen for the instrument. I just might end up buying every book you've written and I'll be giving my highest recommendation for your books to my friends and students. Thank you so much for taking the time to write such great books! &mdash; <b>Peter Rhee</b></p>
