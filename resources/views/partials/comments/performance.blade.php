        <p class="">&ldquo;Just received your newest CD. I have listened to it three times now and, as a result have moved you into that group of excellent uke players I especially admire and know that I can learn a great deal from by listening repeatedly to their stylings (not to mention enjoying their fabulous ukulele music).&rdquo; - <b>Andy Andrews</b> / <em>founder of Ukulele Club of Santa Cruz &amp; the Puna Ukulele &amp; Kanikapila Association</em></p>

        <p>Curt’s repertoire consistently stretches the ukulele envelope by incorporating jazz, blues, and pop into a pleasantly entertaining mix. — <b>Gerald </b>Ross</p>

        <p>Curt, I really enjoyed your set at The Whiskey--your low key intros, mic persona provided a cool contrast with your complex uke technique and ingenious arrangements! - Best wishes, <b>Jared Denhard</b></p>

        <p>I'm glad you had fun and despite being very busy it was a pleasure to meet and hear you. Last night I had a few beers with my "crew" and they were asked who was a standout act , and you won "most technically proficient" player . The audience seemed to have really enjoyed your set and when the audio is ready I'll send it down to you. - Rich <b>"Amazing Dick" Leufstedt - UkeStock 2008</b></p>

        <p><img class="float-right img-thumbnail" width="98" src="/images/cd/Midnight_at_the_Jazz_cafe.png" alt="">Received your CD just prior to leaving on a trip last week. Listened to it for 600 miles. Please keep me in mind should you EVER do another one of jazz standards. The only thing I'm sorry about is that I don't live close enough to come see you play live or to get lessons from you.</p>

        <p>Also thanks for the picks. I've never used that style of pick before, but find that the notes come easier and sound better when using them. They took a bit of getting used to, but now they're all I use.</p>

        <p>Best of luck to you. You're a great player. - <b>Jim Weller</b></p>
