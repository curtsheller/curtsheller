    <p>I wanted to pay you a compliment. (Now don't get a big head!). I have purchased many books over the past 15 years I have been playing and none of them come even close to having the detailed and easy to understand information yours have. I really got a chance to get some practicing in and am finding your books to be such a great learning tool. I also purchased a timer like you suggested and my practice sessions the past 4 days have been my best in years. - Take care, - <b>Nick Matty</b></p>

    <p>( <em>From a posting to the jazz guitar newsgroup</em> ) Rocco, I took a lesson from a guy named Curt Sheller, who lives in Pottstown, PA area. Depending on where you live in the Philly area, that might be a bit of a drive for you, but he is well worth it. He's an excellent teacher. I took a lesson from him a couple of months ago, and had planned on taking a one-hour lesson per month from him, but then my work required me to travel almost every week since then and so I haven't been able to master the assignments he gave me so far.</p>

    <p>I have taken single lessons from a few teachers in the area, and he is by far the best I've seen. He has a web site www.jazzguitarresources.com. He is the only guy that I could find that is truly flexible in terms of scheduling, and to top it off, he's the best teacher for the guitar I've ever found as well... - Bob</p>
